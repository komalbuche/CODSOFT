Welcome to my CODSOFT Java Development Internship repository! This repository contains all the tasks completed during my internship with CODSOFT. It showcases my progress and efforts in learning and applying Java programming concepts.
Task 2: Student Grade Calculator
Created a program that calculates total marks, average percentage, and assigns grades based on the average percentage achieved.
Task 3: ATM Interface
Designed an ATM interface that allows users to withdraw, deposit, and check their account balance.
Task 5: Student Management System
Developed a system to manage a collection of students, including adding, removing, searching, and displaying students.
Each task folder contains a README file with detailed information about the task and how to run the corresponding program.
Code is organized into individual task folders for easy navigation and review.
A video showcasing my work and a demo of my efforts will be hosted on LinkedIn for credibility and proof of work.
